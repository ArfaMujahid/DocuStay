# DocuStay Demo

FastAPI + PostgreSQL backend with a **Vite + React** frontend. Implements Auth (owner & guest registration), Owner/Guest Onboarding, Properties, Invitations, Stays, Region Rules, JLE, Dashboard, Stay Timer, and Notifications.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** (backend)
- **Node.js 18+** (frontend)
- **PostgreSQL** (for backend database)

## Setup

### 1. Backend

1. **Virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   # source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Environment**: Create a `.env` file in the project root and set:
   - `DATABASE_URL` – PostgreSQL connection (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/docustay_demo`)
   - `JWT_SECRET_KEY` – a long random string for JWT signing (min 32 chars)
   - `JWT_ALGORITHM` – e.g. `HS256`
   - `JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` – e.g. `60`

   **Email (optional)**:
   - **Mailgun** (preferred): `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`, `MAILGUN_FROM_EMAIL`, `MAILGUN_FROM_NAME`
   - **SendGrid** (fallback): `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`, `SENDGRID_FROM_NAME`

4. **Database**: Create the database in PostgreSQL (e.g. `docustay_demo`). Tables and region rules are created automatically on backend startup. The schema is defined in `app/models/`; `Base.metadata.create_all()` runs on startup, so **no migration scripts are required for a fresh database**. Scripts in `scripts/migrate_*.py` are only for existing databases that were created before a model change.

5. **Test users (when verification email is not configured)**  
   If you are not using Mailgun/SendGrid, verification emails will not be sent and you cannot complete signup via the UI. Create an owner and a guest user directly in the database:

   ```bash
   python scripts/create_test_users.py
   ```

   This creates:
   - **Owner**: `owner@docustay.demo` / `Password123!` — use **Owner Login** (or Login page).
   - **Guest**: `guest@docustay.demo` / `Password123!` — use **Guest Login** page.

   The script is idempotent: running it again skips users that already exist and prints the same credentials.

### 2. Frontend

1. **Install dependencies** (from project root):
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **API URL** (optional): The frontend calls the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` by default. To override, create `frontend/.env` or `frontend/.env.local` and set:
   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
   ```

## Run the app

Run **backend** and **frontend** in two terminals.

### Terminal 1 – Backend

From the **project root** (with venv activated):

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
```

- API: http://127.0.0.1:8000  
- API docs: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs  

### Terminal 2 – Frontend

From the **project root**:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

- App: http://localhost:3000  

### Quick test

1. Open http://localhost:3000  
2. **Register as owner**: Get Started → Create Owner Account (full name, email, phone, password, state, city, terms).  
3. **Verify**: Enter demo code `123456` on the verify step.  
4. **Owner flow**: Add a property, then invite a guest (invitation link is shown in an alert).  
5. **Guest flow**: Open the invite link (e.g. `#invite/INV-...`), register as guest with permanent address and acknowledgments, then verify with `123456`.  

## Scripts

From the **project root** (with venv activated):

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `python scripts/create_test_users.py` | Create an owner and a guest user (no email verification). Use when Mailgun/SendGrid is not set up. See [Test users](#5-test-users-when-verification-email-is-not-configured) above. |
| `python scripts/delete_pending_invitations.py` | Delete all invitations in pending state from the database. |
| `python scripts/seed_region_rules.py` | Create tables and seed region rules (NYC, FL, CA, TX). |
| `python scripts/test_api.py` | Run backend API tests. |

## API overview

| Module | Prefix | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| A – Auth | `/auth` | Register owner, Register guest (from invite), Login, GET /me |
| B1 – Owners | `/owners` | List/add properties; POST /invitations (guest invite) |
| B2 – Guests | `/guests` | GET/PUT profile (full_legal_name, permanent_home_address, gps_ack) |
| C – Stays | `/stays` | Create stay, list, get |
| D – Region rules | `/region-rules` | List/get region rules (NYC, FL, CA, TX) |

| G – Stay timer | (cron / `POST /notifications/run-stay-warnings`) | Legal warning emails |
| H – Notifications | (internal) | SendGrid email; optional Twilio SMS |

## Audit log (append-only)

DocuStay keeps an **immutable audit trail** (Rule 803(6)): every status change, guest signature, and failed attempt is logged and cannot be edited or deleted. Owners view logs in the dashboard under **Logs** (filter by time, category, search). Logs are written in `app/services/audit_log.py` via `create_log()` and stored in the `audit_logs` table.

## Module flow

1. **Owner**: Register → verify (demo code `123456`) → add **properties** → create **invitations** (guest gets link).  
2. **Guest**: Open invite link → register with permanent address & acknowledgments → verify → guest dashboard.  
3. **Stays**: Create stays (property, dates, purpose, relationship); JLE enforces max stay days per region.  
4. **Dashboard**: Owner sees stays and legal classification; guest sees approved stays and legal notice.  
5. **Notifications**: Optional cron or `POST /notifications/run-stay-warnings` for legal warning emails near stay limits.
