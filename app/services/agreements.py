POA_CONTENT = """Master Power of Attorney (POA)

Overview
The Master POA is a one-time, account-level legal document signed during initial onboarding that establishes DocuStay as the property owner's legal representative for all property protection activities.

1. Who Signs What?
Property Owners ONLY sign the Master POA
Guests DO NOT sign the Master POA
Guests sign a completely different document called the "Guest Agreement" (covered separately)

2. When Is It Signed?
During initial account registration (onboarding)
Before any properties can be added to the system
This is a one-time signature - it covers ALL properties the owner adds, now and in the future

3. What Does It Actually Do?
The Master POA legally designates DocuStay as the owner's "Authorized Agent" to:
- Issue utility authorization tokens (USAT)
- Communicate with utility companies on owner's behalf
- Generate legal evidence packages
- Maintain forensic audit trails
- Act as the "official record keeper" for property status
